CareJR.ai – AI Assisted Healthcare Screening System

An interactive frontend-based healthcare screening system protoype that enables OTP login, patient registration, AI-assisted symptom screening, and structured report generation.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with smooth animations and green-themed healthcare UI.

🚀 Project Overview

CareJR.ai is a simulated AI healthcare screening platform that:

Uses OTP-based login

Collects patient demographic details

Provides AI-powered live symptom screening (simulated)
currently it can only says regarding the following if said like these
1) Fever Case

"I have fever since 2 days with headache and body pain."

2) 🤧 Cold & Cough

"I have cold, cough and mild fever."

3) Stomach Problem

"I have stomach pain and loose motions."

4)🤕 Headache Only

"I am having severe headache."

5) 🤮 Vomiting

"I am vomiting and feeling weak."

6)🤒 Viral Infection Type

"I have fever, weakness and sore t
