⚙️ How It Works

User logs in using phone number

OTP is generated and verified

User enters personal details

Dashboard loads

On clicking New Data:

CareJR AI screening begins

Simulated detection runs

When stopped:

Report is generated

Data stored in localStorage

Report appears in Previous Data section

🧪 AI Simulation Logic

The system simulates:

Live symptom tracking

Real-time analysis

Structured medical reporting

Future upgrades can integrate:

🎤 Real speech recognition (Web Speech API)

📷 Webcam-based symptom detection

☁ Firebase Authentication & Database

📄 PDF Report Generation

🤖 NLP for structured medical extraction

📊 AI Risk scoring algorithms

📌 Use Case Example

A patient logs in → provides details → AI screens symptoms → generates structured report → data saved for future reference → emergency support always accessible.
